Assignment in Python

The assignment operator in python assigns different types of assignment operators. 

Varriables in Python

A variable is basically just a way to give a meaningful name to an area of memory, into which we can place certain values. Varriables are

created when they are first attatched to a value, using= . 

Numeric Data types in Python

The Python integer data type is called int. Integers are just whole numbers - numbers having no fractional part; whereas float is another

part after the decimal point. There is no limit to the size of the values that you can store in Python int.

Floating point numbers or float are used to represent numbers having a fractional part. 

Numeric Operators

There are 7 arithmetic operators in Python :

Subtraction :  In Python, - is the subtraction operator. It is used to subtract 2 values.

Multiplication :  In Python, * is the multiplication operator. It is used to multiply 2 values.

Division :  In Python, / is the division operator. It is used to find the quotient when first operand is divided by the second.

Modulus : In Python, % is the modulus operator. It is used to find the remainder when first operand is divided by the second.

Exponentiation : In Python, ** is the exponentiation operator. It is used to raise the first operand to power of second.

Floor division : In Python, floor division divides two numbers and rounds the result down to the nearest integer.
